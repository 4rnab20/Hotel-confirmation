# Hotel booking confirmation using linear/non-linear classification models
Predicting whether customers are canceling their hotel bookings using a classification model. The outcome of this project is to assist the hotel owners to understand better whether a customer will confirm the booking or revoke it by developing and implementing machine learning methodologies, such as predictive modeling, feature selections, and hyperparameter optimization.
